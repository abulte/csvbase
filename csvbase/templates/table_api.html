    <h2>Private url</h2>
    <p>Your private url for this table
    is <a href="{{table_url}}"><code>{{table_url}}</code></a>.  This has been
    pre-populated in the examples below to make life easier.</p>
    {% endif %}

    <h2>A quick note on two basics</h2>
    <h3>Single url policy</h3>
    <p>In CSVBase, the url for the webpage of a table is also the url for that table&apos;s
      API.</p>

      <p>CSVBase does HTTP content negotiation to detect what is wanted and
        will provide what&apos;s needed - HTML for browsers and CSV for other HTTP
      clients.  You can bypass this by putting a file extension
      (eg <code>.csv</code>) on the end.</p>

    <h3>Basic auth for auth</h3>
    <p>CSVBase uses HTTP basic auth for API authentication.  Your username is
    your username and <strong>your API key</strong> (not your site password!)
    is your password.  This is done to make integration really easy.</p>

    <h3>Anything else</h3>
    <p>CSV files are compatible with nearly everything and you should be able
    to provide either <a href="{{table_url}}">{{table_url}}</a> or a the CSV
    file downloaded from that url to nearly any tool.</p>  Some tools may have
    trouble with HTTP content negotiation, and if so you can just add ".csv" to
    the end of the url to bypass that.<p>

    <h2>REST API</h2>
    <h3>Getting the dataset</h3>
    <p>To download the dataset, just use it&apos;s url - the same as on the website</p>
    <pre>curl {{table_url}}</pre>
    <p>Or to save it to a file with curl, do:</p>
    <pre>curl {{table_url}} -o {{table_name|snake_case}}.csv</pre>
    <h3>Updating the dataset</h3>
    <p>After changing the dataset, send it back with the <code>PUT</code> HTTP Verb (as CSV)</p>
    <pre>{%if g.username == username %}# your api key has been filled in here
{% endif %}curl -XPUT {{private_table_url}} --data-binary @{{table_name|snake_case}}.csv</pre>
  </div>
